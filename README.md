A resume builder application built using flutter.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to build a resume builder application. <br>
A resume builder
is an application that often constitutes an automated process in which you
follow a template and input your information. The builder will ask you a series
of questions and then take the information that you provide to generate a
resume for you. The technologies used were Flutter, Firebase, and GitHub.

## Features
- Responsive and made for both web and app.
- Link is sharable and public just like LinkedIn and naukri.com means others
can see your resume but cannot edit it hence you can share the link to
recruiters or anyone.
- Also a user can build multipage resume here.
